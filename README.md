# Diabetes Prediction
Predicting diabetes is an easy task in machine learning. There are several datasets and challenges around the web. In this repository, we will use several machine-learning techniques to predict diabetes disease.
We will use:
  - Regression
  - Clustering
  - SVMs
  - Ensembles

This repository will use the [Tesco Grocery dataset](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0397-7) and [Pima Indians](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database).
In the first one, we tried to reproduce the results of the "Tesco Grocery 1.0, a large-scale dataset of grocery purchases in London" paper.
In the second one, we used several machine-learning techniques to analyze the Piman Indian dataset and predict the result of diabetes. You can find this dataset on kaggle.
